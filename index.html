<h2> What Made Me Interested in Joining Code Nation</h2>

<p> I chose CodeNation because I saw the advert on Facebook and they said they were offering career paths into the 
cybersecurity sector. I also found out they work in the coding sector which I am more passionate about.
I have a huge background in using computer systems to 
create circuits and I enjoy the idea of working for a company and implementing my ideas and skills to them.<br></p>

<h2>My Cyber Security Background<br></h2>

<p>On my codenation course I learnt how to create a server. I also studied how to connect a server to a website. 
Once the website was ready I explored different techniques to protect it and the server.<br></p>

<h3>A few things that I learnt on the course<br></h3>

<p>{WAMP}<br></p>
<P>WAMP is a piece of software that can be use to create and maintain. It can also be used to defend 
    a server from attack from an unkown intruder. This is very imoportant as major companies need to keep customer imformation safe.<br></P>

<p>{Different types of Hackers}<br></p>
<p>We learnt about all the main different types of hackers this we also learnt about famous hacks that have taken place over the years.
    in different countries <br></p>

<p>{The Policies of Cyber Securirty}<br></p>

<p>On the course, we learnt how governments regulate the distribution of people's information.
    It's also important to know what our rights are as individuals the tutour mentioned these to us and we were able to complete the coursework.<br></p>

<h2>My Engineering Background<br></h2>

<p>I reviewed Circuit diagrams and what symbols on them mean. I also explored different types of circuits and what real world functions they serve.
I explored integrated circuits (chips) and how to program them.<br></p>

<h3>A few things that I learnt on the course<br></h3>

<p>{Circuit design}<br></p>

<p>We were taught how to understand the different circuit symbols and how they can be connected in a circuit. We also created our own circuits as 
    part of a project. <br></p>

<p>{Fault Finding}<br></p>

<p>This is a major part of the engineering industry. This is because machinery needs repairing all the time and maintaining.
    we were given several tasks to make in the year and they ranged from finding faults in a power supply to a remote control car.<br></p>
