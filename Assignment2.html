<br><h1>Assignment 2</h1><br>

<button onclick="window.location.href='index.html'"> Go to Homepage</button>

<h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page <br></h2>

<P>In my website I created 3 pages; The homepage, the assignment 1 page and the assignment 2 page.
    in the section I will explain what I added to each section and explain why I put those things there.
    <br></P>

<h3>Homepage<br></h3>

<p>The homepage is shows facts about myself. Most importantly, It show the reason why I joined CodeNation. 
    Underneath that i put my cyber security background from codenation and lastly i put my college engineering background. I chose to present it 
    in this order because it puts the most recent qualification first. In the cyber security section, I have explained 
    what I did in my time at the codenation school. I used the break and paragraph command on the VScode program to separate the lists to make the 
    paragraphs more organised. <br></p>

<h3>Assignment 1<br></h3>

<p>This page presents assignment one which is Role : Technical Consultant. This is an assignment which puts us
     in a scenario of a real I.T. role this task was the planning of a website 
     and how it can be created quickly and efficiently. I followed all the questions in the brief and to make it easier for 
     people to read, I put the titles for each section at the start of each section. The section name is the exact same name as it is on the 
     assignment brief I could have named 
     the sections differently from the assignment but I did not have the time to do this.<br></p>

<h3>Assignment 2<br></h3>

<p>This page presents assignment two which is also Role : Technical Consultant. This is an assignment which puts us in a scenario of 
    creating a website using the planning techniques presented in assignment one. This section I showed all the relevant information on the differnt 
    techniquies I used in VScode. VScode is needed to make this website. and I explained how I used it.<br></p>

<h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites<br></h2>

<p>According to the BBC, Copyright is legal right that protects the use of your work once your idea has been physically expressed. There are many copyright constraints affecting websites. When an author creates a book and another party plagiarises parts of it to make money this means that they can be sued under Copyright Law This can also apply to anything with an official copyright patent. Such examples include inventions, films, images logo designs etc.<br></p>

<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them.<br></h2>

<p>There are many disabilities to consider catering for on a website. The reason why companies implement these things into a website is because 
    if they dont then they lose a percentage of potential customers. The problem this can lead to is a competitor using these tools on their platforms 
    which will make them lose credibility as they not catering to as many people as they can. These are the main features that companies use below.
      
    <h3>Text to speech<br></h3>
       <p>This is for people who are blind. The computer can speak to you and tell you what commands are available for the user to press.</p>
      
       <h3>Colour aids for the visually impaired.<br></h3>
       <p>Certain people can only see a certain aspect of the colour spectrum. A site needs to make sure that there are different colour options for the situation.</p>
      
       <h3>Dyslexic assistant.<br></h3>
       <p>Sites can make sure that they do not use a white background this can assist a person with dyslexia.</p>
      
       <h3>Epilepsy protection<br></h3>
       <p>When creating a website, do not add any flashing images or videos that can cause people with epilepsy to get an attack.</p>
       <br></p>

<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites<br></h2>

<p>As you can imagine, websites do not use every language or image type. This is because website change and adapt 
    all the time leading to new file inventions. Some website do not include them because they do not have the time to 
    make the site capabale of using every file type. An example of a file type that is not appropriate is TIFF images. This is because 
    the file type cannot be rendered properly by many modern day browsers today. Another type is the BMP image file. This file will normally be very
    huge and will take a long time to process. I have left more common examples below that I used.
     <br></p>

<h3>HTML<br></h3>

<p>This stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This is used to make basic rules for a site such as heading sizes, paragraphs text positions and so on. I used HTML because it 
    is widely used in a lot a websites today for it's simplicity. When I was creating my website I can alter the appearance from the browsers by inspecting element.
    The HTML that I created is all there and easy to alter. <br></p>

<h3>CSS<br></h3>

<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This type of file is responsible for making the website much more desirable and good looking
    This is also used for animations and images in a website. I used CSS for positioning my text and images. I also used it for changing my text style.<br></p>

<h3>JPEG<br></h3>

<p>These images are used mostly in photography. This is because the compression time is very small meaning upload and download speeds 
    are very quick. These are still appropriate for use on websites.<br></p>

<h3>PNG<br></h3>

<p>This stands for Portable Network Graphics. These image types are used for creating. These are more commonly altered images from screenshots. They are either full screenshots or cropped images.
    These are very useful because I need a lot of screenshots for my assignment and a lot them are PNG. It was very easy to crop them and place them 
    into the site. <br></p>

<h2>3.1 Test your site appropriately to make sure it works on different browsers and that everything works as planned - on your GitHub repository for your page include a screenshot of it working in chrome and Firefox <br></h2>


<p>I have tested the link from GitHub on both Chrome and Firefox. The results are below.<br></p>


<p>Chrome<br></p>


<br><img src = "firefoxphone.jpg" alt = "chromeimage"><br>


<p>Firefox<br></p>


<br><img src = "firefoxphone.jpg" alt = "firefoximage"><br>


<h2>3.3 Use Github pages to launch your site<br></h2>


<p>To find the GitHub public link I had to go to the GitHub site. I went to the repository and clicked settings. I scrolled down to find the link below. <br></p>


<br><img src = "livelink.png" alt = "githubimage"><br>
